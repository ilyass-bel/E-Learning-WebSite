# E-Learning-WebSite
E-Learning-WebSite-Project

My project is a website using Django, Python and SQL. The website is named EDUCA and its for distance education. Users can register either as a teacher or as a student. This site allows teachers to post courses, videos, work to be done by students. And also allows students to download their lessons and ask questions to their teachers. Users will be able to login and logout.
